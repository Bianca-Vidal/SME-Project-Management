	<ul>
		<li>Achievements of the previous day</li>
		<li>Unforseen obstacles in achieving the daily goals from the previous day and a plan of action how to overcome them</li>
		<li>Daily goals to aid the progress of the final delivery</li>
	</ul>
	<p> The SCRUM Master will manage and oversee these meeting ensuring delivery of the final product is achieved in accordance to the clients requirements.</p>
	
	<h5>Sprint Review</h5>
	<p>A Sprint is where the final product delivery is broken into smaller managable bitesize pieces known as 'Sprint Iterations'. Such iterations lasts 2-4 weeks. A Sprint Review is a monthly meeting held with the shareholders of the final product delivery to communicate what has been achieved and the progress made. Adaption to the requirements can be easily made upon the feedback of the shareholders where the team will additionally highlight any obstacles that arose within the Sprint. During the Sprint Review, the next plan of action, review of timeline/budget/marketplace and changes within the marketplace are additionally discussed. </p>
	
	<h5>Sprint Retropective</h5>
	<p>At the end of each Sprint the SCRUM Team will look at areas of improvement and look to implementing the suggestions made to the next Sprint to reduce conflict or possible problems.</p>
	
	<h5>Delivery of Final Results</h5>
	<p>This is delivered to the stakeholders every 4 weeks til the final delivery is produced </p>

	<strong> The Agile(SCRUM) PMM is most suitable for Tech Companies and those within the technology industry.</strong>
